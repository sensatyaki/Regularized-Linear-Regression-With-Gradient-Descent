Implementation of linear regression with regularization.

The implementation contains:

 1.Linear regression closed form solution using least square formulation.

 2.Linear regression solution using gradient descent.

 3.A generalized LP-Norm regularization.where the user will give the value of P.
    eg: For P = 2 L2 regularization will be applied.
